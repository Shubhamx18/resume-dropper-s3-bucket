# resume-dropper-s3-bucket
A visually rich, static movie landing page hosted on AWS S3. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates how to create and deploy a static website using Amazon S3 bucket services with proper CORS configuration and public access control. Ideal for learning how to use AWS for front-end hosting without a traditional web server.
